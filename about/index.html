        During the 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic, my home city of Pune in Western India was among the hardest hit. Being the first city in India to report fatalities, the then local administration had little option but to order schools and colleges to close their doors for a week in a bid to stem the contagion. It was during this unwelcome break that I chanced upon an article that claimed that the internet search giant, Google, could predict the spread of the influenza in real time by analyzing the three billion search queries it received every day. It was the first time I had heard of Data Analytics. Since then, I have been captivated by the power embedded in the everyday data that we generate and by the patterns concealed in that data. These hidden patterns hold the solutions to some of humankind’s most profound problems. It was in search for these solutions that I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Information Science with a Big Data Analytics Specialization from the University of Pittsburgh.
